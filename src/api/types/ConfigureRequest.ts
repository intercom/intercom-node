 * The first request we send will allow you to know the workspace where this is happening, the admin who will be configuring the app, and additional context such as where this will be added once complete.
 *
 * For subsequent requests whereby an admin has interacted with a component with a submit action, the request payload will contain the same details with `current_canvas`, `input_values` and the `component_id` also present. This allows you to understand what component the request came from, see what the value of any input was, action anything in your codebase, and then respond knowing what canvas was previously shown beforehand.
